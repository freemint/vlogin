Install
-------
Copy vlogin to any directory of your harddrive and create this line 
in /etc/ttytab:
console		"/path/to/vlogin"			vt52		on secure

With "/path/to/vlogin" modified to where vlogin resides on your harddrive.
Be sure this is the only line with console on the beginig. If there is 
another one put hash mark in front of it.
You can also start vlogin from mint.cnf, but threre is no respawning 
in that case!

In next step copy vlogin.conf to '/etc' and modify its entries to fit your
system.

For mouse support instal moose.xdd to your mint folder.
Currently there are two binary incompatible versions of moose.xdd!
If mouse don't respond correctly your moose is too old, in that case
compile new one from current freemint cvs, or compile vlogin against
older version of moose from cvs.

Thats it, now reboot and enjoy!

vlogin.conf example:
//----------------------------------------------
# sample vdi login config, this file belongs to /etc/

# shell menu item		path to shell					arguments
"XaAes 0.970"			/c/gemsys/xaaes/xaaes.prg	-fvideo 24
"nAes"					/c/gemsys/n_aes/n_aes030.sys
MyAES						/c/gemsys/myaes/myaes2.prg
-
"XaAes 0.990 (km)"	/c/xaaes.km/load.prg
-
sh							/bin/sh
bash						/bin/bash
//----------------------------------------------

You can use any char in label or path string but for spaces, in that case
string must be within quotes!
