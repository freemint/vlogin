Install
-------

Copy vlogin to any directory of your harddrive and create this line 
in /etc/ttytab:
console		"/path/to/vlogin"			vt52		on secure

With "/path/to/vlogin" modified to where vlogin resides on your harddrive.
Be sure this is the only line with console on the beginig. If there is 
another one put hash mark in front of it.

In next step copy vlogin.conf to '/etc' and modify its entries to fit your
system.

For mouse support instal moose.xdd to your mint folder.

Thats it, now reboot and enjoy!

vlogin.conf example:
//----------------------------------------------
# sample vdi login config, this file belongs to /etc

# labels       paths
"N.AES 2.0"    /c/gemsys/n_aes/n_aes030.sys
"XaAes 0.970"  /c/gemsys/xaaes/xaaes.prg
MyAES          /c/gemsys/myaes/myaes.prg
-
sh             /bin/sh
bash           /bin/bash
//----------------------------------------------

You can use any char in label or path string but for spaces, in that case
string must be within quotes!
Passing commad line parameters is currently unsupportd, so don't use 
something like "xaaes -fvideo 26"
