* Make moving with dialog smarter
* Parsing more info from path/command part of string
(entry 'XaAes		/c/gemsys/xaaes/xaaes.prg' works but
'XaAes		"/c/gemsys/xaaes/xaaes.prg -fvideo 26"'does not)
and seting it as argument.
* Terminte vlogin correctly - It seams vlogin stays "alive" 
after starting aes/shell.
* Don't allow selecting separators in menu
* finish img loading and create support for img buttons in tiny_aes
* Support for bitmap as a background (jpeg/bmp/tiff)

Make it smaller/faster/smarter
:o)
