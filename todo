* Finish img loading and create support for img buttons in tiny_aes
* Support for bitmap as a background (jpeg/bmp/tiff)
* Allow passing more info to TinyAES
  - sizes and colours of widgets
  - whatever to use gradients (when aplicable)
  - style of background: solid color, pattern, gradient, image  
* Make moving with dialogs smarter
* Do configurable background in vlogin.conf
* Somehow allow to specify which shells/aeses can be used by which users 
* Redirect output from console to console window
